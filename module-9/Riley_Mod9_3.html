<body>
<p>Two roads diverged in a <span id="yellow">______</span> wood,<br/>
And sorry I could not travel both<br/>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br/>
And looked down one as far as I could<br/>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br/>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br/>
Because it was <span id="grassy">______</span> and wanted wear;<br/>
Though as for that the passing there<br/>
Had worn them really about the same,</p>
<p>And both that morning equally lay<br/>
In leaves no step had <span id="trodden">_______</span> black.<br/>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br/>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br/>
I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
<p>I shall be telling this with a <span id="sigh">____</span><br/>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br/>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br/>
I took the one less traveled by,<br/>
And that has made all the difference.</p>
