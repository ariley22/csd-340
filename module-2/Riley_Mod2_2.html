    <h2>Learning to Use CSS</h2>
    <p class="intro">My name is Amanda Riley. I was born in 1990. I come from a small suburb in New Jersey.</p>

    <p>I have a younger sister named Nicole. I also have a large extended family, including 24 first cousins. We used to have a lot of parties together when I was younger. Now we all live farther away from each other.</p>

    <p>My first job was at a supermarket. Then I worked online for a nonprofit. Then I was a professional musician for a while. Now I am working in retail again. Next year I hope to become a software developer.</p>

    <p><span class="sentence">Between a full-time retail job, two Bachelor's courses and one Masters course, I don't have much free time.</span> But when I do, I like to learn languages, watch sitcoms, play logic puzzles, and hang out with friends and family. In the past few years I became fluent in German, and now have many German friends.</p>
